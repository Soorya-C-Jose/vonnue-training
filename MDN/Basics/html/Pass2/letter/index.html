         Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
      <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temparatures exceeding
         30<sup>o</sup>C(86<sup>o</sup>F),when the audience
         size exponentially increases(effect of 3*10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
      <li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u>constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
   </ol>
   </p>
   <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research
      to take, required
      staff and other resources and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
