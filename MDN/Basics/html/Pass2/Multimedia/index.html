            But down there it would be dark now, and not the lovely lighted aquarium
            she imagined it to be during the daylight hours, eddying with schools of tiny
            delicate animals flolating and dancing slowly to their own serene currents
            and creating the look of a lving painting. that was wrong in any case . the
            kcean was different from an aquarium, which was an artificial environment.
