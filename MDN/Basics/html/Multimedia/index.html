        <p>But down there it would be dark now, and not the lovely ligthted aquarium she imagined 
            it to be during the daylight hours, eddying with schools of tiny,
            delicate animals floating and dancing slowly to their own serene currents and creating 
            creating the look of a living painting. Thats wrong, in any case.The ocean was different
            from an aquarium, which was an artificial environment.the ocean was a world.
            And a world is not art.Dorothy through about the living things that moved in that world.
            large , ruthless and hungry . like us up there.
