Github 
Online Backup
Repositories
* Local : refers to things our computer
* Remote : refers to the things that are online

Upload to Github : push
Download from Github : pull

push : git push origin(which repository) main (branch name)

git push origin master --set-upstream : (next time you run git push
you can just run this command(git push) and git
will automatically memorize origin and master for you)

git push only pushes commits

--amend :: instead of creating a new commit it's going to overwrite
the previous commit.

git push origin main -f :: (force push) it means to push this commit to github even if it will
overwrite.

git clone :: it is used to point to an existing repo and make a clone
             or copy of that repo at in a new directory, at another
             location.

Remote tracking branch : we pushed our entire branch upto github
and now github essentially has a copy of branch

SSH Keys :: simply it is a file that we created on our computer
then whenever we run git push we're going to pass this to github ,
and this key is going to give us access.




git init : creates a new repository 

BRANCHING :: work on multiple things at the same time

steps for branching 
* creating a new branching
        git branch (branch name) 
* switching the branch 
         git checkout (branch name) which branch we want to switch 


MERGING 
    helps us to combine all the branches together.

 * switch to the current working branch (using checkout)
 * git merge branch name(the other one)

 MERGE CONFLICTS 
     we're going to create two branches and on each of the branches
     were going to change the same file on the same line.

* create a branch
* and change the same file on the same line of two files
* merge(git merge conflict -m "")


FEATURE BRANCH WORKFLOW 
* A workflow
* Astep by step process for using Git and Github.

_ create a feature branch
_ upload feature branch to Github
_ create a pull request (do code reviews)
_ merge feature branch into main/master branch
