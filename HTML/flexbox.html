          <h2>India</h2>
          <p>India is a land with a vast variety of wildlife and a large variety of cultures. Situated in South Asia’s heartland, India is a densely populated country. It is a vastly diverse country in terms of culture, climate, religion, and language. India has chosen a number of emblems to represent our country’s image. Saffron, white, and green make up the Indian national flag. The Ashok chakra in the centre has a navy blue 24-spoke wheel that represents virtue.
India is well-known for possessing the world’s greatest cultural diversity. Even for Indians, visiting and exploring every culture in India is quite difficult.

          <h2>Internet</h2>
          <p>Because of internet, our lives have become more convenient as compared to the times when we don’t have internet. Earlier, we have to stand in queues to send mails (letters), for withdrawing or depositing money, to book tickets, etc. but after the dawn of the internet, all these things become quite easy. Also, we do not have to waste our precious time standing in queues.
Also, the internet has contributed a lot to the environment as much of the offices (government and private), school and colleges have become digital that saves countless paper.
Although, there is no doubt that the internet had made our life easier and convenient but we can’t leave the fact that it has caused many bigger problems in the past. And with the speed, we are becoming addict to it a day in will come when it will become our basic necessity.</p>
